## Migrate 🐛

Migrate to Database

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

---
Create table posts into Datavase

```
php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
```

---
Check status of migration:

```
php artisan migrate:status
```

---
To roll back the latest migration operation:

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

The `migrate:reset` command will roll back all of your application's migrations:

```
php artisan migrate:reset
```

## Table

```php
Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->string('email');
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

---
Check available table:

```php
if (Schema::hasTable('users')) {
    // The "users" table exists...
}

if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'email')) {
    // The "users" table exists and has an "email" column...
}
```

## Queries

```php
Route::get('/insert', function () {
    return DB::table('posts')->insert([
        'title' => '2 Learn Laravel so easy ^^',
        'body' => "2 Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
    ]);
});

Route::get('/read_update', function () {
    return DB::table('posts')->where('id', '1')->update(['title' => 'title updated']);
});

Route::get('/delete', function (){
    return DB::table('posts')->where('id', '2')->delete();
});
```
